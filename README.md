# Duplicate-Images-Finder

In the Debug Folder you need the Folders AllFiles and DuplicateFiles.
The AllFiles folder should contain the image collection. Therefore if you want to check your collection put your images there.
The DuplicateFiles Folder will then contain all the duplicates that were extracted from your collection. 
Therefore you can either delete or keep them. (Your collection will still have all your images just without any duplicates)

PS: If the folders AllFiles and Duplicate Files do not exist, then you can create them manually!
